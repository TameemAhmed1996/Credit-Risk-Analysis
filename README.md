• The Balanced Accuracy Is 93%.

• The High Risk Precision Is Around 7% With 91% Sensitivity. 

• The Low Risk Precision Is Around 100% With 94% Sensitivity.



Summary:


• All Models Displayed Weak Precision Towards Indicating If A Credit Risk Is High.

• I Recommend Using The Ensemble Model To Predict Credit Risk Because The Ensemble Model Tends To Acquire High Recall Percentages And High Sensitivity Percentages.
